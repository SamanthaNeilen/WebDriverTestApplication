<h1>WebDriverTestApplication</h1>
<p>
    This project was created with Visual Studio 2017 Community Edition.
</p>
<p>
    This project will be used to demonstrate Selenium and Wininum UI tests.
</p> 
<h3>How to use</h3>
<p>
	Build the solution to see the tests in the test explorer.
</p>
<p>
	To run the WebTest_Selenium_TestForm test, first run the CodedUITestApplication.Web without debugging. 
	Next start the test from the Test Explorer window.
</p>
<h3>Extra note on running Selenium tests</h3>
<p>
This project uses the files in the Assets folder of the test project. All files in the folder have a build action and get copied to the bin folder where they are referenced from the code or web.config.
When using older MS test frameworks that run in the seperate TestResults/Out folder, you will need to use a TestSettings file to get the Assets folder deployed to that directory.
